Ruby De Bruijn Sequences
========================

This branch is a compendium to the De Bruijn project. It provides
support code which a participate can use to start-off implementing De
Bruijn sequences. 

See the 
[main branch](https://github.com/dvberkel/debruijn "Main branch of debruijn project")
for an exposition about the entire project.

Goals
-----

The project has a number of tests. All of which are failing at the moment.

Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to make all the test pass.

Environment
-----------

We are using 
[Python](http://www.python.org/ "Homepage for Python") to execute the
mission. Python should know about the modules.

We issued the following commands when started on this project.

    > export PYTHONPATH=.

### Running Tests

    > python debruijn/test/test_all.py

Will run all the tests in the project.
